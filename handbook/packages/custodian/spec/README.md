# Jasmine Spec

The Custodian library using standalone [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) browser runner.

~~For simplicity, you must manually export the added specs in the `index.spec.ts` file.~~

By default, running with `npm test -w custodian` will build the specs and launch the Cordova browser platform.
